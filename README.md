# OrCo
OrCo compiler toolchain
[Developed on streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvZASPqsD2VjqJ6968gEhoLlCn0i0rqHH)

## Goals
OrCo has the following goals:
- The language should be easy to integrate with other programming languages (Rust, C++, Java, Python),
for example have structs with generics(templates) and something to work with trait bounds/abstract classes.
