orco development is currently guided by those goals:
1. Runtime features such as:
   - Hot code reloading
   - JIT
   - Debugging
   - Interpreting
   - Cross-compilation
2. LSP features:
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Code completion
   - Hover info
   - Go to [definition/uses/etc.]
   - Inline docs
3. Easy language interop & generation of C (or C-like) headers, transpilation to C
